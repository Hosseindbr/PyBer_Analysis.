# PyBer Analysis
## Goal
In this challenge we aimed to provide ridesharing information for V. Isualize to have an insight on ride-sharing service. To this end, we initially merged two data set (city_data.csv and ride_data.csv) into a single data set and obtained a summary of Data containing information regarding the total drivers for each city type, total amount of fares for each city type, he average fare per ride for each city type, average fare per driver for each city type. Then, we generate multiple line plots that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city.


## Resources

city_data.csv 

ride_data.csv

Python version 3.9.12 

Conda version 4.13.0 

anaconda Command line client version 1.10.0
## Results
Figure 1 demonstrates the total fare by city type in 2019 as a function of time. As we can see all groups almost follow a similar pattern in which fare amounts in each group was fluctuating within a certain a range. The average fare in urban group is significantly higher than those of suburban.

                          Figure 1. Total fare in each city type during Jan-May 2019 period


Noteworthy, the total fare in urban group is two times and 9 times fold higher than those of suburban and rural groups (Figure 2). Furthermore, the results imply that the highest average fare per ride and driver belongs to the rural and suburban city types, respectively. This shows that the trips in these locations are less economical to the customers.

## Sumary
Several recommendations can be made in order to reduce disparities between urban, suburban and rural areas:
1.	Performing market studies to balance supply and demand in the rural and suburban area to reduce the service cost to the customer and increase the number of rides.
2.	Hiring more drivers in the suburban and rural locations to reduce the fare per driver.
3. Number of drivers is higher than number of rides in urban area which means that the demand and request is imbalanced and it is recommended to reduce the number of drivers in this location to creat a profit margin for the company.
4.	Analyzing the data for the rest of the year and different year is crucially important before making a decision.
